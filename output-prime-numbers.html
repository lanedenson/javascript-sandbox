<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>To find all prime numbers (numIterate) between 0 and num. Prime numbers are those that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.</p>    
<h2>Approach:</h2>
<p>Loop 1: Iterate through all integers less than or equal to num.</p>
<p>Loop 2: For each number, iterate through 2 and 1 less than that number (isItPrime)</p>
<p>Test to see if the humber is divisible by any number other than itself</p>
<p>Do this by using the remainder operator (%); divide numIterate by isItPrime. If the remainder is 0 at any point, then it is NOT prime</p>

    for (let isItPrime = 2; isItPrime < numIterate; isItPrime++){
        if (numIterate % isItPrime == 0) continue outer;
    }
    console.log(numIterate);
