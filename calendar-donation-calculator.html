    <h1>Calendar Donation Calculator</h1>
    <p>If everyone picks a date on the calendar for October, and donates that date's amount (e.g. October 15 = $15), how
        much will be donated in total?</p>

    <h3>Further refinements: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Can this be done with fewer than 3 variables? (Probably) </li>
        <li>Create a graphical representation of a calendar (flexbox) and put the relevant info in each cell.</li>
        <li>Provide a dropdown with a list of months and calculate the total based on the month selected.</li>
    </ul>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        let count;
        let sum;
        let previousSum = 0;
        for (count = 1; count < 32; count++) {
            sum = previousSum + count;
            document.write("Day " + count + " total: " + sum + "<br/>");
            document.write("(" + previousSum + " + " + count + " = " + sum + ")<br/>");
            document.write("<br/>");
            previousSum = sum;
        }
        document.write("The total amount donated over 31 days will be $" + sum + ".");
